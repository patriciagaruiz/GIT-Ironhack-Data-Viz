<h1 align="left"> Main Objectives </h1>

The data visualization project is an important step in the workflow of a data analyst. It helps people take decision in a data driven manner and gain insights.

The population projections gathering in this project will support the analysis and simulations of the macroeconomic impacts.

Population projections for Brasil were prepared by IBGE (2010 to 2060) and IPEA (2060 to 2100). 

World population projections were prepared by ONU and The Lancet.

Data about ONU available at: https://news.un.org/pt/story/2019/06/1676601 and https://news.un.org/pt/story/2017/06/1589091-populacao-mundial-atingiu-76-bilhoes-de-habitantes.

The dataset has 25.723 lines and 24 columns.

Cleanned Dataset has 6.302 lines and 23 columns.

<h1 align="left"> Libraries </h1>

I used in this analysis: pandas, numpy, re, seaborn, pandas_profiling.

<h1 align="left"> 1. Are there more fatal than non-fatal attacks? </h1>

This answer needs a clean column called: Fatal (Y/N).
First of all, I used 'groupby' to discover the number of lines per value. Here the results: 2017, N, M, Y, y, UNKOWN.
I read the lines with values different from Y or N and changed (with mask and loc) the wrong values by Y, N or X (for unclear cases where the identification was not possible).

CONCLUSION: There are more non-fatal attacks according to the data.

Total Shark Attacks with Known Results: 5692 attacks

Fatal Shark Attacks: 1389 attacks / 24.4 %

Non Fatal Shark Attacks: 4303 attacks / 75.6 %

*** Attacks with Unknown Results: 71 attacks / 1.23 % (disregarded in the previous analysis)

<h1 align="left"> 2. Are there more attacks for male or female? </h1>

This answer needs a clean column called: Sex.
First of all, I used 'groupby' to discover the number of lines per value. Here the results: . , F, M, N, lli.
I read the lines with values different from M or F and changed (with mask and loc) the wrong values by M, F or X (for unclear cases where the identification was not possible).

CONCLUSION: There are more attacks to male according to the data.


Total Shark Attacks with Known Gender: 5735

Male Shark Attacks: 5098 attacks / 88.89 %

Female Shark Attacks: 637 attacks / 11.11 %

*** Attacks with Unknown Results: 71 attacks / 1.23 % (disregarded in the previous analysis)

<h2 align="left"> OTHERS CONCLUSIONS </h2>
Crossing valid lines related to fatal attacks (5.692) and attacks by gender (5.735) I extracted a double groupby:

<h1 align="left"> 3. Are shark attacks influenced by hemisphere? </h1>

This answer needs a clean column from main database called: Country.
Even though this column does not provide the information needed to answer the question because it doesnâ€™t tell in which hemisphere the country is, I used a database of coordinates (latitude/longitude) to find out this information. I used a database of coordinates (latitude/longitude) for countries to find out this information. Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/max-mind/world-cities-database.

I used 'unique' to discover the values into the main database (199 countries) and compared (merge) with the database of coordinates. I used 'mask' and 'loc'to update wrong values.
Countries after cleanning database: 141 

CONCLUSION: There are more shark attacks in Northern Hemisphere

Total Shark Attacks with Known Hemisphere: 6206 attacks

Hemisphere Northern: 3432 attacks / 55.3 %

Hemisphere Southern: 2774 attacks / 44.7 %

*** Attacks with Unknown Hemisphere: 96 attacks / 1.52 % (not inside the previous analise)
