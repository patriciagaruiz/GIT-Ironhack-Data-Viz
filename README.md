<h1 align="left"> Main Objectives </h1>

The data visualization project is an important step in the workflow of a data analyst. It helps people take decision in a data driven manner and gain insights.

<h1 align="left"> Gathering Process </h1>


<h1 align="left"> The Datasets </h1>

The mission of the Global Shark Attack File is to provide current and historical data on shark/human interactions for those who seek accurate and meaningful information and verifiable references.
Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teajay/global-shark-attacks.


<h1 align="left"> Import File </h1>

The dataset has 25.723 lines and 24 columns.

Cleanned Dataset has 6.302 lines and 23 columns.

<h1 align="left"> Libraries </h1>

I used in this analysis: pandas, numpy, re, seaborn, pandas_profiling.

<h1 align="left"> 1. Are there more fatal than non-fatal attacks? </h1>

This answer needs a clean column called: Fatal (Y/N).
First of all, I used 'groupby' to discover the number of lines per value. Here the results: 2017, N, M, Y, y, UNKOWN.
I read the lines with values different from Y or N and changed (with mask and loc) the wrong values by Y, N or X (for unclear cases where the identification was not possible).

CONCLUSION: There are more non-fatal attacks according to the data.

Total Shark Attacks with Known Results: 5692 attacks

Fatal Shark Attacks: 1389 attacks / 24.4 %

Non Fatal Shark Attacks: 4303 attacks / 75.6 %

*** Attacks with Unknown Results: 71 attacks / 1.23 % (disregarded in the previous analysis)

<h1 align="left"> 2. Are there more attacks for male or female? </h1>

This answer needs a clean column called: Sex.
First of all, I used 'groupby' to discover the number of lines per value. Here the results: . , F, M, N, lli.
I read the lines with values different from M or F and changed (with mask and loc) the wrong values by M, F or X (for unclear cases where the identification was not possible).

CONCLUSION: There are more attacks to male according to the data.


Total Shark Attacks with Known Gender: 5735

Male Shark Attacks: 5098 attacks / 88.89 %

Female Shark Attacks: 637 attacks / 11.11 %

*** Attacks with Unknown Results: 71 attacks / 1.23 % (disregarded in the previous analysis)

<h2 align="left"> OTHERS CONCLUSIONS </h2>
Crossing valid lines related to fatal attacks (5.692) and attacks by gender (5.735) I extracted a double groupby:

<h1 align="left"> 3. Are shark attacks influenced by hemisphere? </h1>

This answer needs a clean column from main database called: Country.
Even though this column does not provide the information needed to answer the question because it doesnâ€™t tell in which hemisphere the country is, I used a database of coordinates (latitude/longitude) to find out this information. I used a database of coordinates (latitude/longitude) for countries to find out this information. Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/max-mind/world-cities-database.

I used 'unique' to discover the values into the main database (199 countries) and compared (merge) with the database of coordinates. I used 'mask' and 'loc'to update wrong values.
Countries after cleanning database: 141 

CONCLUSION: There are more shark attacks in Northern Hemisphere

Total Shark Attacks with Known Hemisphere: 6206 attacks

Hemisphere Northern: 3432 attacks / 55.3 %

Hemisphere Southern: 2774 attacks / 44.7 %

*** Attacks with Unknown Hemisphere: 96 attacks / 1.52 % (not inside the previous analise)
